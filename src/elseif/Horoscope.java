					+ "Cerebral, chatty, loves learning and education, charming, and adventurous.The Gemini symbol is that of a pair of twins. This is because this sign rarely likes to do anything alone. Gemini are never happier than when they are sharing ideas and concepts with someone else. Communication is a key element for this sign, so many of this sign go into occupations that include some communication in some large capacity. Curiosity is a key characteristic of this sign, and they are people persons. Gemini are great at parties because they can find almost anything to talk about with anyone. Gemini are adventurous by nature and so engage in traveling as often as they can as it affords them the opportunity to meet new people, experience new ideas, and to learn new concepts.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "Gemini are air signs, which means that they have light, airy personalities, with an effervescence that seems to draw people to them. This sign craves intellectual stimulation and often will push the envelope physically, mentally, and spiritually. If someone were to live out the book, Eat, Pray, Love it would be this sign as they are gluttons for new experiences, sometimes out of the box and out of the way experiences and people. This sign is also incredibly creative and are given to giant leaps of intuition, which makes them great entrepreneurs, designers, writers, speakers, and anything artistic. They love bright vibrant colors.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "Upside: Gemini are great conversationalists, and are charming people. Interesting to speak with, Gemini know a little bit about a lot of things. They have a great sense of humor and are generally optimistic people. Gemini often make their own fun, despising boredom.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "Downside: Gemini like to be the center of attention; always. When they perceive the situation to not be in their favor, they leave it. This can include relationships, careers, and friendships. Because of this need to be seen as important, Gemini will sometimes stretch the truth. When they are focused only on themselves they can be largely unsympathetic and rude. Male Gemini tend to change jobs often, and female Gemini change partners often due to boredom.\n"

					+ "Likeable, energetic, passionate, sensitive.The fish is the symbol given to this sign, primarily because fish live in a secretive and mysterious place. Pisces tend to be daydreamers, often dreaming up brilliant ideas and plans which they are unable to facilitate themselves. They have a happy and vibrant inner life that few get to share or see. They are deeply caring about others and don’t like to see people become unhappy.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "They are tremendously dedicated individuals, staying with companies for decades where others move from one job to the next. So, too, with relationships. Others may find Pisces difficult to get to know because they don’t often readily share their underlying passion and compassion. Pisces signs tend to be highly and deeply religious, and sometimes will go overboard with their devotion to their particular faith. This can also lead to intolerance and bigotry.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "Upside: Pisces are empathetic people, often feeling badly for someone whose life is not going well. They feel the need to reach out to those who are less fortunate and will often find themselves involved in drama that they hadn’t intended. They are kind, caring individuals who feel everything deeply, even though you would not know it on the surface. They can be creative and imaginative when they believe that they have support to make those leaps.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "Downside: Because they feel everything so intensely, this sign can often become a clinical worrier. They will worry that they are not worrying. This tendency to worry also leads to indecision on their part, fearing that if they make a decision that others disagree with that they will have upset someone. Pisces don’t like to hurt people’s feelings and as such become conflicted when they have to make decisions. They do not do well as leaders, but are impressive support personnel. Sometimes the have a lack of follow through due to this indecisiveness and require a gentle nudge from other signs to complete tasks on time.\n"

					+ "Leo signs tend to like relaxation, preferably someplace warm and comfortable. Leo likes the big picture, not the small details and fine print. Things that are too complicated, involved, or boring, they have no patience for. They are natural leaders and don’t often do well in situations where they have to take orders from others.\n"

Leos love material goods and luxury and want those that they love to experience this wealth as well. Leo are generally accepting of everyone initially and make decent, lasting relationships.\n"
					+ "\n"
					+ "Downside: Leo have a great sense of self-worth which can cross the line into arrogance. Leo can tend toward extravagance if they are not satisfied with what they have. Because they like to be in charge, they can often become smothering to their mates and friends, which may leave them alone (which Leo hates). Divorce and loss are devastating to this sign as they are all about the community and family.\n"

They are most unhappy when they are tied to a normal routine and can become restless in situations where there is not enough variety involved. Because they travel so much and are eager to experience new things, those of this sign are fun to be around and often have large numbers of friends. They question everything and think that everyone should do the same.\n"

Creativity is at the core of who they are and Sagittarians are often creating and recreating their living situations, work situations, and human relationships. Sagittarians are spiritually inclined and are among the types that would travel to the Himalayas to commune with the monks, or take the book, Eat, Pray, Love and go to each spot mentioned in its pages to seek their own enlightenment.\n"

					+ "Downside: Confining a Sagittarian and not allowing for ample space to roam will make this sign rude, and uncooperative. Sagittarians often come up with unrealistic, big plans, but lack the ability to follow through with them. This isn’t because they aren’t capable, but rather they can become sidetracked chasing another avenue of adventure or thought. Sagittarians are about the bigger picture and details often bog them down and bore them.\n"
